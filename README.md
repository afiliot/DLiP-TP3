# Deep Learning in Practise (MVA) : small data and deep learning
This mini-project proposes to study several techniques for improving challenging context, in which few data and resources are available.

- The folder `weights` contains the pretrained weights from DCGAN used by https://github.com/csinva/pytorch_gan_pretrained/tree/master/cifar10_dcgan/weights. 

- The folder `simulations`contains the 10 independent trainings (and testings) made for each model.
